  ## Overview
  As part of my Front-End Developer bootcamp, I am currently working on completing the 8th challenge. In this task, developers are tasked to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This tool enables quick and easy creation of README files, allowing project creators to focus more on their projects.

  ## Description
  As a developer, having a README generator is essential for quickly creating a professional README for a new project. This command-line application accepts user input and generates a high-quality, professional README.md file. It includes sections such as Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. Users can input the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, choose a license from a list of options, and provide their GitHub username and email address.
